This is a binary diffing tool running on Windows platform. It utilizes the power of IDA disassembler and shows the silimar functions and different basic blocks. These functionalities are very useful for analyzing binary security patches without source code. It has been few years since security researchers used binary diffing to look into the vendor patches. And original Darungrim was one of the tool of choice to the them. Now it's DarunGrim2 with faster engine and easy to use interface. It's fully opensource and you can fine-tune the behaviour of the engine or you can apply your own binary diffing algorithms for testing.
